    <h2>CHICKEN KABULI PULAO (AFGHANISTAN)</h2>
    <p>Pulao is a flavor-packed dish made with basmati rice, dried fruit, and warming Middle Eastern spices like cumin,
        cardamom, and floral saffron threads. This version uses bone-in chicken, but feel free to swap it out for your
        favorite protein of choice or load up on the veggies for a vegetarian version.</p>

        <h2 class="rk_column_heading">Directions</h2>
        <ol id="recipe-preparation">
            <li>
                Place the rice in a colander and rinse under cold running water until the water runs clear. Place in
                a bowl, cover with water, and soak for 30 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                If using, season the chicken on all sides with salt and pepper. If not using chicken, skip to step 6.

            </li>
            <li>
                In a large skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of oil over medium-high heat. Once hot, add the chicken pieces
                to the skillet and sear for 3-4 minutes per side until lightly browned.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add in the chicken stock, bring to a boil, then reduce the heat to a simmer. Cover with a lid and let
                simmer for about 20 minutes, turning the chicken over halfway through. (If you are using chicken on
                the bone, cook for approximately 30 minutes). If not using chicken, skip this step.
            </li>
            <li>Remove the chicken and set aside. Reserve the chicken stock.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fill a large pot with about 12 cups of water and bring to a boil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Drain the rice and add to the pot with 2 teaspoons of kosher salt.
            </li>
            <li>
                Boil for 8 minutes. (The rice should be about doubled in size and not completely tender.)
            </li>
            <li>Drain the rice.
            </li>
            <li>
                Return about 2/3 of the rice to the empty pot. Layer the chicken pieces on top of the rice (if using)
                and cover with the remaining rice.
            </li>
            <li>Sprinkle with the cumin and cardamom seeds.
            </li>
            <li>Pour the chicken stock back into the pot, cover with a lid and cook on low for about 15
                minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Meanwhile, in a small bowl, add two tablespoons of hot (but not boiling) water and the saffron
                threads. Set aside to let the saffron bloom, about 10 minutes
            </li>
            <li>
                In a small skillet over medium-low heat, melt 1 tablespoon of ghee (or butter), to make your nutty
                topping. Add in the raisins and almond slivers and saute until the almonds just begin to brown,
                about 2-3 minutes. Remove from the heat.
            </li>
            <li>Take a spoonful of cooked rice from the pot with the chicken. Stir into the nutty topping
                and add in the saffron-infused water.
            </li>
            <li>
                Transfer the chicken and rice to a platter. Sprinkle with saffron almond topping and serve warm.
            </li>
